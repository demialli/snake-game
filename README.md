# snake-game
here's the snake game i made for days 20-21 of the app brewery's 100 days of code! :3
this year (or last year now what it's 2025) i decided to LOCK IN with python bc compsci is the only thing i see myself doing in the future.
thus, found and started the 100 days of python course! i know quite a bit abt python from doing it in school but i wanted to learn more bc it's funn.
then i gave up bc i am procrastinator prime so now i'm starting a new one! 
this was one of my fav projects to make tho and i keep coming back to it so i thought i might asw put in on here as my first project
it's very very simple ik but it would've been stupider if i'd continued with my original idea for it instead of just watching the walkthrough loll
okay have fun
idk how writing scores to the textfiles will work on here
idrk how github works tbh but ehhhh
